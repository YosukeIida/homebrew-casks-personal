  # Same payload as the official homebrew/cask `codex`, plus this one step.
  #
  # Homebrew quarantines the download and copies the flag onto every extracted
  # file (cask/download.rb, Quarantine.propagate). The official cask then runs
  # `bin/codex completion` to generate shell completions, so the first exec of
  # the new binary happens inside `brew upgrade` and Gatekeeper's "downloaded
  # from the Internet" dialog blocks the upgrade until someone clicks it in the
  # GUI. There is no user-side opt-out: `--no-quarantine` is gone in Homebrew 7,
  # and the cached download is re-quarantined on every reuse.
  #
  # Preflight steps run after extraction but before `binary` and
  # `generate_completions_from_executable` (cask/artifact/abstract_artifact.rb),
  # so clearing the flag here removes the dialog both from the upgrade and from
  # the first launch. It also covers the bundled `codex-path/rg`.
