  # Same payload as the official homebrew/cask `claude-code@latest`, plus this
  # one step.
  #
  # Homebrew quarantines the download, so the first launch of `claude` after
  # every upgrade shows Gatekeeper's "downloaded from the Internet" dialog and
  # waits for a click in the GUI (it hangs over SSH, or when an agent runner
  # starts `claude`). Clearing the flag at install time removes the dialog for
  # every launch path; nothing re-adds it until the next upgrade, which runs
  # this step again.
